# Replacing battery, upgrading RAM and SSD  
  
Backgroud: Macbook Pro 2.53G mid-2009 unibody upgrade (MacbookPro 5,4)  
Battery and hard drive change kit (including SATA enclosure and 5 types of screwdrivers), get from ifixit.co.uk.  
For actually SSD (I chose a samsung evo 1T) and memory (4Gx2 DDR3), bought from MrMemory.  
All worked well, follow instructions
